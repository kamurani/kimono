## First pass 

- Scan all 3D structures of phosphosites (pLDDT > threshold)
- Compare PDB structures with AF where structure exist 
- similar to `structuremap`, develop a score for each site along with its `in.IDR` etc. scores 
- this score represents the "non-linearity" of the particular motif 
- first, generate a sequence for each *N* Ã… bubble, where the sequence numbers start from 0 (each residue).  The sequential nature of these can be visualised (i.e. is it 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 0, 1, 10, 11 etc. ) 
- either order by `RES` seq position, or by increasing distance from `MOD_RSD` 
- see if this correlates with pLDDT of (psite | average in bubble) which i suspect it will
